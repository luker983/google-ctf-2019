# Work Computer (sandbox)

## Prompt

Having found the information you were looking for, while detailed, it presents you with an interesting dilemma. There is a network of "computers" not completely dissimilar to your computrator-machine on your ship. You find yourself in possession of the credentials of an individual on the planet named "SarahH." Great, with these you can get right into the secret world of an earthling without them knowing you're there. You access "SarahH home network," to find two computers: "work" and "home." Not knowing what either of these are, you have to make a decision.

With the confidence of conviction and decision making skills that made you a contender for Xenon's Universal takeover council, now disbanded, you forge ahead to the work computer.   This machine announces itself to you, surprisingly with a detailed description of all its hardware and peripherals. Your first thought is "Why does the display stand need to announce its price? And exactly how much does 999 dollars convert to in Xenonivian Bucklets?" You always were one for the trivialities of things.

Also presented is an image of a fascinating round and bumpy creature, labeled "Cauliflower for cWo" - are "Cauliflowers" earthlings?  Your 40 hearts skip a beat - these are not the strange unrelatable bipeds you imagined earthings to be.. this looks like your neighbors back home. Such curdley lobes. Will it be at the party?

SarahH, who appears to be  a programmer with several clients, has left open a terminal.  Oops.  Sorry clients!  Aliens will be poking around attempting to access your networks.. looking for Cauliflower.   That is, *if* they can learn to navigate such things.
