# Reversing a cellular automata (Crypto)

## Prompt

It's hard to reverse a step in a cellular automata, but solvable if done right.

## Steps

1. Go to `https://cellularautomata.web.ctfcompetition.com/`
2. Construct cellular automata
3. Keyspace is 2^64, but can be reduced to 2^29 because 0's are only produced by 111 or 000
